# Tetris
Tetris Game I created using HTML and Javascript based a tutorial from Ryan Schafer (Rhuno).
Uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  Goal of the game is to allign the blocks into rows by moving and rotating the shapes
using the arrow keys.  If the blocks stack up to the top of the screen, you lose the game.
